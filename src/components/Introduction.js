const Introduction = () => <h5 className="introduction">I am a software developer with 4 years commercial experience currently seeking a role that relates to my interest in PHP and ReactJS. Previously worked in web engineering and agile environments, contributed suggestions on renovating one's legacy system, meeting deadlines, adding time slot data in a new page for their new system. I am constantly learning by maintaining my applications, an online neural network to recognise images sent from my android app via STOMP sockets to a server. Moreover I have learned modern frameworks including Angular and Spring through online courses and am eager to learn more.</h5>
