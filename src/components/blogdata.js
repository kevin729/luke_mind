My knowledge in computing excelled during my placement year in 2018, where I worked on a ERP system for engineers who install and repair starlifts. Luckly, I had already experimented with JavaEE and tomcat, so I already had an understanding of serlvets and JSPs, but their system of using a single servlet per app to read the xml to call the scripts to run the business logic and the view to display by matching url path allowed me to understand how server logic can be implemented in different ways. I learned running calling soap endpoints, groovy scripts for extracting entity data, creating and calling services from the server using both forms as well as ajax calls, and frontend and backend validation.",

Times new roman looks more professional, however can be hard to read in a small font, therefore it is better to use this font for either small sentances or pages with big text. Georgia seems to be better suited for both UI text and single paragraphs like an introduction text. I also later found that for contact details, a simple plain font works better, so I also used Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif on the profile page.",

Moreover, seperating the code and data into components allows a much more clear view of the UI by mapping or looping the JSON array. This can be used for UI on a sidebar, blogs, recipes etc. It is also convenient to start the application with Javascript insteading of linking the script, and focuses the JavaScript code with the html in the JavaScript file.",
